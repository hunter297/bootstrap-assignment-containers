            <h3><i>WRESTLING</i></h3>
            <p> The first real traces of the development of wrestling date back to the times of the Sumerians, 5000 years ago. The Epic
            of Gilgamesh written in cuneiform, the sculptures and the low reliefs, are numerous sources that reveal the first
            refereed competitions, accompanied by music. There are also many historical and archaeological traces of wrestling in
            Ancient Egypt. Among them, it is worth mentioning in particular the drawings discovered in the tombs of Beni-Hassan
            representing 400 couples of wrestlers. These drawings, as well as many other vestiges, witness the existence of
            corporations of wrestlers in Ancient Egypt, wrestling rules and refereeing codeFor the Greeks, wrestling was a science and a divine art, and it represented the most important training for young men.
            Athletes wrestled naked, with their bodies coated with olive oil and covered with a layer of very thin sand to protect
            the skin from sunlight or from cold during winter. After wrestling, they scraped this layer off with an instrument
            called strigil and washed themselves with water. Fights were similar to those of freestyle wrestling, as shown by
            drawings and inscriptions from that time. The competitor who first threw his opponent or first brought him down - either
            on his back, hips, chest, knees or elbows - was proclaimed the winner.</p><br>

            <h3><b>FOOTBALL</b></h3>
            <P>Modern football originated in Britain in the 19th century. Since before medieval times, “folk football” games had been
            played in towns and villages according to local customs and with a minimum of rules. Industrialization and urbanization,
            which reduced the amount of leisure time and space available to the working class, combined with a history of legal
            prohibitions against particularly violent and destructive forms of folk football to undermine the games status from the
            early 19th century onward. However, football was taken up as a winter game between residence houses at public
            (independent) schools such as Winchester College, Charterhouse, and Eton College. Each school had its own rules; some
            allowed limited handling of the ball and others did not. The variance in rules made it difficult for public schoolboys
            entering university to continue playing except with former schoolmates. As early as 1843 an attempt to standardize and
            codify the rules of play was made at the University of Cambridge, whose students joined most public schools in 1848 in
            adopting these “Cambridge rules,” which were further spread by Cambridge graduates who formed football clubs. In 1863 a
            series of meetings involving clubs from metropolitan London and surrounding counties produced the printed rules of
            football, which prohibited the carrying of the ball. Thus, the “handling” game of rugby remained outside the newly
            formed Football Association (FA). Indeed, by 1870 all handling of the ball except by the goalkeeper was prohibited by
            the FA.
            
            The new rules were not universally accepted in Britain, however; many clubs retained their own rules, especially in and
            around Sheffield. Although this northern English city was the home of the first provincial club to join the FA, in 1867
            it also gave birth to the Sheffield Football Association, the forerunner of later county associations. Sheffield and
            London clubs played two matches against each other in 1866, and a year later a match pitting a club from Middlesex
            against one from Kent and Surrey was played under the revised rules. In 1871 15 FA clubs accepted an invitation to enter
            a cup competition and to contribute to the purchase of a trophy. By 1877 the associations of Great Britain had agreed
            upon a uniform code, 43 clubs were in competition, and the London clubs initial dominance had diminished.</P><br>

            <h2><del>BASKETBALL</del></h2>
            <P>In the early years the number of players on a team varied according to the number in the class and the size of the
            playing area. In 1894 teams began to play with five on a side when the playing area was less than 1,800 square feet
            (167.2 square meters); the number rose to seven when the gymnasium measured from 1,800 to 3,600 square feet (334.5
            square meters) and up to nine when the playing area exceeded that. In 1895 the number was occasionally set at five by
            mutual consent; the rules stipulated five players two years later, and this number has remained ever since.
            
            Since Naismith and five of his original players were Canadians, it is not surprising that Canada was the first country
            outside the United States to play the game. Basketball was introduced in France in 1893, in England in 1894, in
            Australia, China, and India soon thereafter, and in Japan in 1900.While basketball helped swell the membership of YMCAs because of the availability of their gyms, within five years the
            game was outlawed by various associations because gyms that had been occupied by classes of 50 or 60 members were now
            monopolized by only 10 to 18 players. The banishment of the game induced many members to terminate their YMCA membership
            and to hire halls to play the game, thus paving the way to the professionalization of the sport.
            
            Originally, players wore one of three styles of uniforms: knee-length football trousers; jersey tights, as commonly worn
            by wrestlers; or short padded pants, forerunners of today’s uniforms, plus knee guards. The courts often were of
            irregular shape with occasional obstructions such as pillars, stairways, or offices that interfered with play. In 1903
            it was ruled that all boundary lines must be straight. In 1893 the Narragansett Machinery Co. of Providence, Rhode
            Island, marketed a hoop of iron with a hammock style of basket. Originally a ladder, then a pole, and finally a chain
            fastened to the bottom of the net was used to retrieve a ball after a goal had been scored. Nets open at the bottom were
            adopted in 1912–13. In 1895–96 the points for making a basket (goal, or field goal) were reduced from three to two, and
            the points for making a free throw (shot uncontested from a line in front of the basket after a foul had been committed)
            were reduced from three to one.Baskets were frequently attached to balconies, making it easy for spectators behind a basket to lean over the railings
            and deflect the ball to favor one side and hinder the other; in 1895 teams were urged to provide a 4-by-6-foot
            (1.2-by-1.8-meter) screen for the purpose of eliminating interference. Soon after, wooden backboards proved more
            suitable. Glass backboards were legalized by the professionals in 1908–09 and by colleges in 1909–10. In 1920–21 the
            backboards were moved 2 feet (0.6 meter), and in 1939–40 4 feet, in from the end lines to reduce frequent stepping
            out-of-bounds. Fan-shaped backboards were made legal in 1940–41.
            
            A soccer ball (football) was used for the first two years. In 1894 the first basketball was marketed. It was laced,
            measured close to 32 inches (81 cm), or about 4 inches (10 cm) larger than the soccer ball, in circumference, and
            weighed less than 20 ounces (567 grams). By 1948–49, when the laceless molded ball was made official, the size had been
            set at about 30 inches (76 cm).
            
            The first college to play the game was either Geneva College (Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania) or the University of Iowa.
            C.O. Bemis heard about the new sport at Springfield and tried it out with his students at Geneva in 1892. At Iowa, H.F.
            Kallenberg, who had attended Springfield in 1890, wrote Naismith for a copy of the rules and also presented the game to
            his students. At Springfield, Kallenberg met Amos Alonzo Stagg, who became athletic director at the new University of
            Chicago in 1892. The first college basketball game with five on a side was played between the University of Chicago and
            the University of Iowa in Iowa City on January 18, 1896. The University of Chicago won, 15-12, with neither team using a
            substitute. Kallenberg refereed that game—a common practice in that era—and some of the spectators took exception to
            some of his decisions.</P><br>
